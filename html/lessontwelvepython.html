        <h1>Python Loops</h1>
        <p>
        Loops are conditional statements used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.</p>
        <h2>If... Else loops</h2>
        <p>
        If loops are formated as shown in the image below. The figure below it will help you understand the logic
        behind if conditionals. Basically, the computer will first check if the condition in the if statement
        is true. If it is, then the computer will execute the block of code inside of the if statement. 
        If the condition is not true, then the computer will move onto the elif statement if there is one and check if
        the elif condition is true. There can be more than one elif statement so the computer will 
        go through each one and test the statement. If none of the conditions return true then the computer
        will execute the block of code under the else statement. 
        </p>
        <p>If loops often utilize operators in the conditions so here are some of the operators you should know-</p>
        <p>x == y - checks if x is equal to y.<br>
        x > y - checks if x is greater than y.<br>
        x >= y - checks if x is greater than or equal to y.<br>
        x < y - checks if x is less than y.<br>
        x <= y - checks if x is less than or equal to y.<br>
        x != y - checks if x is not equal to y.<br>
        </p>

        <p> It's also important to know about operators. These operators are used if there are more than one statement
        being tested. The or operator returns true if one or both of the conditions are true and the and operator returns 
        true when both of the conditions are true.</p>

        <h2>For Loops</h2>
        <p>A for loop is used for iterating over an iterable like a string, list, range or numbers, etc.
        You can use a for loop to run a block of code for every item in the iterable.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here are some important terminology you should know-<br>
        break - a statement used to stop the loop before it goes through all of the items in the iterable.<br>
        continue - a statement that wil stop the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next.<br>
        pass - this statement is often put in empty loops and functions to avoid getting an error.<br>
        range() - a function often used with the for loop to repeat a set of code a specific number of times.
        It can take in up to three parameters. The first is the number you want to start at(the default is 0), the second is the number
        at which the loop will stop running and the third number is an increment for the numbers.
        The only parameter that is mandatory is the number you want the range to go up to. 
        Finally, you can use an else statement after a for or while loop to specify what should be done if the 
        conditions return True though its an uncommon practice.</p>
        </p>

        <img src='https://cdn.glitch.com/1ec3f49c-c727-4187-8082-d28c4e9b2889%2Fimg50.PNG?v=1629828684554'>
        <h2>While Loops</h2>
        <p>
        A while loop is used to execute a series of command as long as a command is true. It is very
        similiar to for loops and they can sometimes be used interchangeably. One key difference however, is that
        for loops are used when you know how many times the code must be executed and while loops can be used in the
        same context or when you don't know how many times the code will run until the condition returns true. 
        For examples, while loops are used to create game loops because the programmer doesn't know when the 
        user will lose the game and the code must stop executing. 
        </p>
        <p> Another key difference between a for and while loop is that you must define a variable before 
        a while loop. During each iteration of the loop, the computer will check the status of that variable and use
        it to determine if it will continue iterating over its block of commands. Also, as a general rule of thumb, 
        programmers don't use range() in while loop conditionals since it is considered bad coding practice.
        </p>
