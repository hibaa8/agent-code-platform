      <h2>Intro to CSS</h2>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages â€”
        for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
        content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
        decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
        path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
        syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
        HTML.
      </p>

      <h2>Why to Learn CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design
        language intended to simplify the process of making web pages
        presentable.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        CSS is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great
        Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development
        Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning CSS:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Create Stunning Web site - CSS handles the look and feel part of a web
          page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of
          fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid
          out, what background images or colors are used, layout
          designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes
          as well as a variety of other effects.
        </li>

        <li>
          Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a
          professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill.
        </li>

        <li>
          Control web - CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides
          powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most
          commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.
        </li>

        <li>
          Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML and CSS
          then other related technologies like javascript, php, or angular are
          become easier to understand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hello World Using CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Just to give you a little excitement about CSS, I'm going to give you a
        small conventional CSS Hello World program. As you can see the CSS code
        is in the style section.

      />

      <h2>Applications of CSS</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned before, CSS is one of the most widely used style language
        over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          CSS saves time - You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in
          multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and
          apply it to as many Web pages as you want.
        </li>

        <li>
          Pages load faster - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write
          HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and
          apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster
          download times.
        </li>

        <li>
          Easy maintenance - To make a global change, simply change the style,
          and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.
        </li>

        <li>
          Superior styles to HTML - CSS has a much wider array of attributes
          than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in
          comparison to HTML attributes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Multiple Device Compatibility - Style sheets allow content to be
          optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML
          document, different versions of a website can be presented for
          handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.
        </li>

        <li>
          Global web standards - Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it
          is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS
          in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.
        </li>
      </ul>
