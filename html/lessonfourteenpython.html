        <h1>Python Classes/Inheritance</h1>
        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <img src='https://cdn.glitch.com/1ec3f49c-c727-4187-8082-d28c4e9b2889%2Fimg53.PNG?v=1629828709359'>
        <p>
        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and methods into individual objects.
        Basically, objects are like components of a system. Think of classes as representing any common object or being like a human.
        So, lets create a class called 'Human'. First, we need to think of properties that define humans. Some properties include 
        height, weight, and hobbies. Second, what behaviors can humans perform? Well, humans can run, jump, kick, and do so much more but we'll stick
        with those three for now. Now, we have defined the properties and behaviors that define humans so we can create many human objects
        that have the properties that we just mentioned. Using this basic example, you can understand class properties, methods, and objects. 
        This class is also visualized in the graphic above.
        </p>
        <p>Now lets implement the steps we discussed in code. First, lets create the properties for a human object. A class starts off with an init method where
        parameters are turned into instance variables, or variables belonging to the objects of the class. For the human class, 
        the init method would look something like this-
        <img src='https://cdn.glitch.com/1ec3f49c-c727-4187-8082-d28c4e9b2889%2Fimg54.PNG?v=1629828717533'>
        <p>Some important things to note here is that you must always pass in 'self' as the first parameter in the init
        and all other class methods. Furthermore, every instance variable and method you reference must be preceded by self.
        Lastly, you can easily turn any parameter into an instance variable by doing self.instance_var_name = parameter_name, as shown above.
        </p>
        <p>Now, lets implement the methods for our Human class. Methods translate into functions inside of a class, so we will create
        three methods for each of our behaviors and have certain blocks of code run when these methods are called.
        </p>
        <img src='https://cdn.glitch.com/1ec3f49c-c727-4187-8082-d28c4e9b2889%2Fimg55.PNG?v=1629828727648'>
        <p>
        In the example above, we added an extra instance variable, name to make the output more interesting. Now pay attention
        to how we spaced the methods. They all have the same indentation as the init class, signifying to the computer that they are inside of the
        Human class. Furthermore, each method takes in the 'self' parameter. This is crucial because without the parameter, these functions would
        not be methods of the Human class meaning, we wouldn't be able to use the instance variables or have any properties of classes.
        </p>
        <p>Now, lets create a Human object that has the properties and methods we just defined. Meaning, we can easily access
        all the instance variables and methods that we defined for the object that we define without having to write any code.
        </p>
        <img src='https://cdn.glitch.com/1ec3f49c-c727-4187-8082-d28c4e9b2889%2Fimg56.PNG?v=1629828748045'>
        <p>As you can see, we can easily access all the properties and methods of Human through our sally object simply by doing
        object_name.method() or object_name.property. You can also change properties by doing object_name.property = new_value. 
        To delete a property, do del object_name.property.</p>
        <h2>Inheritance<h2>
        <p>
        Now lets say we want to get some properties from another class. But since we are good programmers, we wont just
        copy paste the methods and properties we need into our new class. Instead, we will inherit the the other class
        and then take methods and properties that we need. 
        </p>
        <p>Parent class - the class being inherited from, also known as the base class</p>
        <p>Child class - the class that inherits from the parent class, also called the derived class</p>
        <p>The child class gets all the properties of methods of the parent class, as shown below.</p>
        <img src='https://cdn.glitch.com/1ec3f49c-c727-4187-8082-d28c4e9b2889%2Fimg57.PNG?v=1629828755470'>
        <p>You can also add new properties to the child class and build upon the properties that it 
        inherited from the parent class by using an init method. You can also overwrite the values of the instance
        variables in the parent class by redefining them in the child class. However, if you create an init method, 
        remember to initialize the parent class inside first with all the necessary parameters. If you don't initialize the parent
        class then you lose access to its properties and methods. To initialize the parent class, you can either call 
        parent_class_name.__init__(self, parameters) or you can do super.__init__(self, parameters).
        </p>
        <p>Similiarly, you can add new methods to the child class and you can overwrite the methods in the parent
        class by redefining them. Keep in mind that you can use the instance variables and methods of the parent class 
        in your methods. Furthermore, remmeber to pass in the self parameter into the methods, as always.
        </p>
