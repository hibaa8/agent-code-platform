          What is JavaScript?
        </h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is
          high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
          curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
          object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS,
          JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.Over
          97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often
          incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
          dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
          As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
          functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
          programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
          expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
          (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output
          (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In
          practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript
          APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web
          browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems,
          most notably servers and a variety of applications. Although there are
          similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name,
          syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are
          distinct and differ greatly in design.

        History of JavaScript
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Mosaic web browser was released in 1993. As the first browser with a
        graphical user interface accessible to non-technical people, it played a
        prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web. The
        lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which
        released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. Navigator
        quickly became the most used browser.
      </p>

      <p style="padding-left:35%;">
        <img

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static,
        lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in
        the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene
        to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a
        scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve
        this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming
        language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to
        devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme
        or other extant scripting languages.Although the new language and its
        interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as
        part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to
        JavaScript for the official release in December.Eich claims that
        HyperTalk syntax and handler names influenced JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it
        is directly related to Java. Since Java was the hot new programming
        language at the time, this has been characterized as a marketing ploy by
        Netscape to give its own new language cachet.
