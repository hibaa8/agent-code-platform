      <h2>What is HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
        HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
        wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or
        act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink
        to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or
        smaller, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>Creates the structure for all web pages on the internet</p>
      <p>
        A file ending in .html lets your browser know that you are coding in
        html
      </p>

      <h2>A brief History about HTML</h2>
      <p>
        The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since
        then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely
        used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an
        official standard in December 1999.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is
        a standard markup language that is used to create other markup
        languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML
        (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple
        Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common
        language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications.
        This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the
        W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML
        became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is
        very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary
        for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between
        applications would be impossible. You'll learn more about the
        differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML
        1.0. However, in recent years, the W3C (in collaboration with another
        organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new version of
        HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draft specification, and
        is not yet an official standard. However, it is already widely supported
        by browsers and other web-enabled devices, and is the way of the future.
        Therefore, HTML5 is the primary language taught in this course.
      </p>

      <h2>Examples of types of content that can be included on web pages</h2>

      <p>
        The following table shows a list of many of the types of content that
        can be added to web pages using different versions of HTML. In the early
        days of the Web, HTML (version 1.2) was very simple, but over time new
        versions were released that added more and more features. Still, if web
        designers wanted to add content or features that HTML didn't support,
        they would have to do so with non-standard proprietary technologies such
        as Adobe Flash. These technologies would require users to install
        browser plug-ins, and in some cases meant that certain users would be
        unable to access the content (for example, iPhones and iPads don't
        support Flash).
      </p>

      <p>
        HTML5 has added support for many new features that will make it possible
        to do more with HTML, without relying on non-standard proprietary
        technologies.
